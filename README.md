# Users and Interests
A small program written in Sinatra, Ruby, HTML, and CSS for Launch School's RB175 course. 

This course is designed teaching students how Sinatra works, so the project is intentionally very lightweight.

For fun, I added some additional CSS to give the project some garish colors using the [vaporwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporwave) color asthetic. 


The project can be [viewed live on Heroku here](https://afternoon-sands-64989.herokuapp.com/users).
